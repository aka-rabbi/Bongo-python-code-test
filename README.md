## runtime and memory requirements 

- problem 1 and 2 will have O(depth^n). n is the logest length from root.  
- problem 3 has two recursive call on each function execution. The time complexity will be O(2^n).
- for all the problems the space complexity will be proportional to the depth of the tree.

I referred to https://jarednielsen.com/big-o-recursive-time-complexity/ to infer the above statements.
